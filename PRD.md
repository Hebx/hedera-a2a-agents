# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Hedera A2A Agents System

### Document Information

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Status**: Implementation Complete
- **Project**: Hedera Agent-to-Agent Communication System

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Hedera A2A Agents System is a multi-agent architecture built on Hedera Hashgraph that enables autonomous agent-to-agent communication and settlement using the x402 payment protocol. The system consists of three specialized agents that work together to process, verify, and settle transactions in a decentralized, trustless environment.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents operate independently without human intervention
- **Decentralized Communication**: Uses Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for message passing
- **Automated Settlement**: Integrates x402 protocol for seamless payment execution
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Supports Base Sepolia network for USDC payments
- **Transparent Process**: All operations are recorded on-chain for auditability
