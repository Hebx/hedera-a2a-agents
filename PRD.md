# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Hedera A2A Agent System

### Document Information

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Status**: Implementation Complete

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Hedera A2A Agent System is a multi-agent architecture built on Hedera Hashgraph that enables autonomous agent-to-agent communication and settlement using the x402 payment protocol. The system consists of three specialized agents that work together to process, verify, and settle transactions in a decentralized, trustless environment.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents operate independently without human intervention
- **Decentralized Communication**: Uses Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for agent messaging
- **Trustless Settlement**: Implements x402 protocol for secure payment execution
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Integrates Hedera Hashgraph with Ethereum-compatible networks

---

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Traditional financial systems require centralized intermediaries for transaction processing, verification, and settlement. This creates:

- Single points of failure
- High operational costs
- Trust dependencies
- Limited interoperability between systems

### 2.2 Solution

The Hedera A2A Agent System provides a decentralized solution where autonomous agents:

1. Analyze transaction proposals
2. Verify compliance with business rules
3. Execute settlements automatically
4. Communicate through immutable consensus
