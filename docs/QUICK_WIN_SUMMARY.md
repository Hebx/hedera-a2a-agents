## 🎬 Demo Video Script

Record a 3-5 minute video showing:

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)

"I built an HCS-10 multi-agent system on Hedera that autonomously settles NFT royalties. This saves marketplaces $18K/year by eliminating manual work."

### 2. Architecture (1 minute)

- Show 3 agents: Analyzer, Verifier, Settlement
- Explain HCS-10 communication
- Show HCS topics
- Highlight autonomous operation

### 3. Live Demo (2 minutes)

```bash
# Run your demo
npm run demo:hackathon

# Show:
# - Agent initialization
# - HCS-10 registry
# - Agent communication
# - Payment execution
# - Transaction hash
```

### 4. Results (30 seconds)

- Show transaction hash on Base Sepolia
- Demonstrate instant settlement
- Highlight cost savings

### 5. Conclusion (30 seconds)

"This demonstrates HCS-10 standard for autonomous AI agent coordination on Hedera!"

## 🎯 Key Points to Emphasize

### In Documentation:

1. ✅ HCS-10 standard compliance
2. ✅ Multi-agent communication
3. ✅ Agent discovery and registry
4. ✅ Autonomous operation
