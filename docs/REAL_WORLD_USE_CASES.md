---

## 1. E-Commerce Payment Platform

**Use Case:** Build a Stripe-like platform with autonomous payment processing

### Implementation

```typescript
import { IntelligentVerifierAgent, SettlementAgent } from 'hedron-agent-sdk'

class EcommercePaymentService {
  private verifier = new IntelligentVerifierAgent()
  private settlement = new SettlementAgent()
  
  async processOrder(order) {
    // AI validates order automatically
    const validation = await this.verifier.validateInvoice({
      amount: order.total,
      merchantId: order.merchantId,
      items: order.items
    })
    
    // Auto-settle via x402 if approved
    if (validation.approved) {
      await this.settlement.executePayment({
        amount: order.total,
        network: 'base-sepolia',
        asset: 'USDC',
        recipient: order.merchantWallet
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### Business Impact

- **Reduce payment processing time** from days to seconds
- **80% cost reduction** compared to traditional payment processors
- **Automatic fraud detection** reduces chargebacks

## 2. B2B Supply Chain Platform

**Use Case:** Automated procurement and vendor payment system

### Implementation

```typescript
import { A2ANegotiation, SettlementAgent } from 'hedron-agent-sdk'

class SupplyChainPlatform {
  async negotiateContract(buyerAgentId, vendorAgentId, terms) {
    const negotiation = new A2ANegotiation(a2aProtocol)
    
    // Agents negotiate autonomously
    const agreement = await negotiation.negotiate(
      buyerAgentId,
      vendorAgentId,
      terms
    )
    
    // Record on Hedera, auto-pay on delivery
    await negotiation.recordAgreement(agreement)
    await this.settlement.settleOnAgreement(agreement)
  }
}
```

### Business Impact

- **80% reduction in procurement time** through autonomous negotiation
- **Instant vendor payments** improve supplier relationships
- **Reduced administrative overhead** with automated workflows
- **On-chain agreement recording** ensures transparency and compliance

### Real-World Scenario

A B2B marketplace (like Alibaba for B2B) uses Hedron SDK to:

## 3. Freelancer Marketplace

**Use Case:** Automated payout processing for work submissions

### Implementation

```typescript
import { AnalyzerAgent, HumanInTheLoopMode, SettlementAgent } from 'hedron-agent-sdk'

class FreelancerPlatform {
  async processPayout(workSubmission) {
    const analysis = await this.analyzer.analyzeWork(workSubmission)
    
    // Human approval for large payments
    if (submission.amount > 1000) {
      const hitl = new HumanInTheLoopMode({ threshold: 1000 })
      const approved = await hitl.requestApproval({
        type: 'payout',
        amount: submission.amount,
        freelancerId: submission.freelancerId
      })
      if (!approved) return
    }
    
    // Auto-settle payment
    await this.settlement.executePayout(analysis)
  }
}
```

### Business Impact

- **Automated payout processing** eliminates manual review for standard submissions
- **60% reduction in operational costs** by reducing manual payout processing
- **Faster freelancer payments** improve platform satisfaction
- **Human-in-the-loop** ensures security for high-value transactions

### Real-World Scenario

An Upwork-like freelancer platform integrates Hedron SDK to:
- Automatically analyze work submissions for quality
- Process small payments instantly without human review
- Require human approval for large payments (security)
- Support both HBAR and USDC payouts based on freelancer preference
- Reduce support tickets related to delayed payments

## 4. SaaS Subscription Billing

**Use Case:** Flexible multi-chain subscription management

### Implementation

```typescript
import { SettlementAgent } from 'hedron-agent-sdk'

class SubscriptionService {
  async renewSubscription(subscription) {
    const paymentMethod = await this.getPaymentMethod(subscription.userId)
    
    // Flexible settlement based on user preference
    if (paymentMethod.type === 'hedera') {
      // Native HBAR (low fees, fast)
      await this.settlement.settleHBAR({
        amount: subscription.amount,
        recipient: subscription.merchantAccount
      })
    } else {
      // USDC on Base (stablecoin)
      await this.settlement.settleUSDC({
        amount: subscription.amount,
        recipient: subscription.merchantWallet,
        network: 'base-sepolia'
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### Business Impact

- **Multi-chain flexibility** reduces payment friction
- **50% lower fees** compared to traditional payment processors
- **Faster settlements** improve cash flow
- **User choice** between HBAR (fast, low fees) and USDC (stable)

  async payRoyalty(salePrice, creatorWallet) {
    const royalty = salePrice * 0.10 // 10% royalty
    
    // Auto-pay creator via x402
    await x402Payment({
      amount: royalty,
      recipient: creatorWallet,
      network: 'base-sepolia',
      asset: 'USDC',
      description: 'NFT Royalty Payment',
      resource: '/nft-royalty'
    })
  }
}
```

### Business Impact

## 6. Invoice Factoring Platform (RWA)

**Use Case:** Tokenize invoices as tradeable RWA assets

### Implementation

```typescript
import { TokenService, SettlementAgent } from 'hedron-agent-sdk'

class InvoiceFactoringPlatform {
  async tokenizeInvoice(invoice) {
    // Create RWA token on Hedera
    const tokenId = await tokenService.createInvoiceToken(
      invoice.id,
      invoice.amount,
      invoice.vendorId,
      invoice.description,
      invoice.dueDate
    )
    
    // Token can now be traded on secondary market
    // Auto-settle when due
    await this.settlement.settleOnDueDate(tokenId)
  }
}
```

### Business Impact

- **Unlock $3T invoice factoring market** through tokenization
