### 4. supply-chain-fraud-detection-demo.ts ✅ (NEWLY ENHANCED)

**What Changed:**
- Added transaction approval workflow for payments after fraud check
- Creates scheduled transaction with fraud check results in memo
- Vendor approval required before payment execution
- Falls back to direct execution when connections unavailable

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Direct execution
const paymentTx = new TransferTransaction()...
const paymentResponse = await paymentTx.execute(this.hederaClient)

// After: Transaction approval (with HCS-10 enabled)
if (useHCS10Approval) {
  const scheduledTx = await txApproval.sendTransaction(
    connection.connectionTopicId,
    paymentTx,
    `Supply chain settlement: ${amount} HBAR to vendor`,
    {
      scheduleMemo: `Fraud-checked agreement: ${agreementMemo}`,
      expirationTime: 3600
    }
  )
  await txApproval.approveTransaction(scheduledTx.scheduleId)
}
```

**Lines:** +101 additions

**Impact:**
- Enhanced security: Multi-sig approval for fraud-checked payments
- Audit trail: Fraud check results stored in schedule memo
- Vendor control: Vendor must approve before payment executes

---

### 5. invoice-automation-demo.ts ✅ (NEWLY ENHANCED)

**What Changed:**
- Added connection establishment between Analyzer and Verifier agents
- Added transaction approval for high-value invoices (when HITL required)
- Connection-based messaging when available
- Falls back to direct execution when connections unavailable

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Direct A2A protocol
const a2a = new A2AProtocol(hcsClient, accountId, capabilities)

// After: A2A with HCS-10 connection support
const analyzerConn = analyzer.getConnectionManager()
const a2a = new A2AProtocol(
  hcsClient,
  accountId,
  capabilities,
  analyzerConn,  // Connection manager
  undefined      // Transaction approval handled separately
)

// Connection establishment
if (useHCS10Connections && analyzerConn && verifierConn) {
  await analyzerConn.requestConnection(verifierId, { timeout: 30000 })
}
```

**For High-Value Invoices:**
```typescript
// Transaction approval for invoices requiring HITL (>$500)
if (useHCS10Approval && requiresApproval) {
  const scheduledTx = await txApproval.sendTransaction(
    connectionTopicId,
    paymentTx,
    `High-value invoice payment: $${invoice.amountUSD}`,
    {
      scheduleMemo: `Invoice: ${invoice.invoiceId} | ${invoice.description}`,
      expirationTime: 3600
    }
  )
  await verifierTxApproval.approveTransaction(scheduledTx.scheduleId)
}
```

**Lines:** +138 additions

**Impact:**
- Connection-based agent communication
- Multi-signature approval for high-value invoices
- Enhanced audit trail with invoice details in schedule memo

---

### 6. nft-royalty-x402-demo.ts ✅ (NEWLY ENHANCED)

**What Changed:**
- Added optional fee-based connection configuration
- Demonstrates creator monetization (creator can charge connection fees)
- Shows HCS-10 fee configuration without enforcing it (royalties paid regardless)

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// HCS-10: Optional fee-based connection (creator monetization)
if (useHCS10Connections && settlementConn) {
  const feeConfig = HCS10FeeConfig.fromOptions({
    hbarFee: 1,
    recipientAccountId: royalty.creatorAccountId || royalty.creatorAddress,
    treasuryFee: 0
  }).build()
  
  console.log('💰 Connection Fee Configuration:')
  console.log(`   Fee: ${feeConfig.hbarFee || 0} HBAR`)
  console.log(`   Recipient: Creator`)
  console.log('   (Creator can monetize connections to their agent)')
}
```

**Lines:** +30 additions

**Impact:**
- Demonstrates fee-based connections feature
- Shows how creators can monetize agent connections
- Educational: Shows configuration without changing royalty payment flow

**Note:** This demo uses x402 for cross-chain USDC payments, so HCS-10 transaction approval is less relevant. Fee-based connections showcase is the main HCS-10 feature here.

### 7. hbar-direct-x402-demo.ts ✅ (NEWLY ENHANCED)

**What Changed:**
- Added transaction approval for large HBAR payments (>=50 HBAR threshold)
- Multi-signature approval workflow for high-value transfers
- Falls back to direct x402 execution for smaller amounts

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// HCS-10: Use transaction approval for large amounts
const useTransactionApproval = useHCS10Connections && payment.amount >= 50

if (useTransactionApproval) {
  const scheduledTx = await txApproval.sendTransaction(
    connectionTopicId,
    paymentTx,
    `Large HBAR payment: ${payment.amount} HBAR`,
    {
      scheduleMemo: payment.purpose,
      expirationTime: 3600
    }
  )
  await txApproval.approveTransaction(scheduledTx.scheduleId)
} else {
  // Fallback: Direct x402 execution
  await settlement.triggerSettlement(verificationResult)
}
```

**Lines:** +135 additions (net)

**Impact:**
- Enhanced security for large transfers (>=50 HBAR)
- Multi-signature approval for high-value payments
- Small amounts still use fast direct execution

---

## Common Patterns Across All Demos

### 1. Environment Variable Check

All demos check for `USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS=true`:

```typescript
const useHCS10Connections = process.env.USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS === 'true'
```

### 2. Conditional Feature Activation

HCS-10 features only activate when:
- `USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS=true` is set
- Connection managers are available
- Connections can be established

### 3. Graceful Fallback

All demos implement fallback logic:

```typescript
if (useHCS10Approval && connectionsAvailable) {
  // Use HCS-10 transaction approval
  await txApproval.sendTransaction(...)
} else {
  // Fallback to direct execution
  await paymentTx.execute(...)
}
```

### 4. No Breaking Changes

All demos maintain exact same behavior when `USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS` is not set or `false`.

## How HCS-10 Features Are Used

### Connection Establishment

**Demos Using It:**
- `orchestrator.ts` - Establishes 3-agent connections
- `invoice-automation-demo.ts` - Analyzer ↔ Verifier connection

**Pattern:**
```typescript
const conn = await connectionManager.requestConnection(agentId, { timeout: 30000 })
if (conn.status === 'established') {
  // Use connection.connectionTopicId for messaging
}
```

### Transaction Approval

**Demos Using It:**
- `orchestrator.ts` - Payment approval workflow
- `supply-chain-negotiation-demo.ts` - Vendor payment approval
- `supply-chain-fraud-detection-demo.ts` - Post-fraud payment approval
- `intelligent-invoice-demo.ts` - High-value invoice approval
- `invoice-automation-demo.ts` - High-value invoice approval
- `hbar-direct-x402-demo.ts` - Large amount approval (>=50 HBAR)

**Pattern:**
```typescript
const scheduledTx = await txApproval.sendTransaction(
  connectionTopicId,
  transaction,
  description,
  { scheduleMemo, expirationTime }
)
await txApproval.approveTransaction(scheduledTx.scheduleId)
```

### Fee-Based Connections

**Demos Using It:**
- `nft-royalty-x402-demo.ts` - Creator monetization example

**Pattern:**
```typescript
const feeConfig = HCS10FeeConfig.fromOptions({
  hbarFee: 1,
  recipientAccountId: creatorAccountId,
  treasuryFee: 0
}).build()
```

## Behavioral Changes Summary

### Without HCS-10 (`USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS=false` or unset)

**All Demos:**
- Work exactly as before
- Direct topic messaging
- Immediate transaction execution
- CLI prompts for HITL (where applicable)

### With HCS-10 (`USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS=true`)

**Demos with Connections:**
- Attempt to establish agent connections
- Use connection topics when available
- Falls back to direct topics if unavailable

**Demos with Transaction Approval:**
- Schedule transactions for approval
- Multi-signature workflow
- Enhanced audit trail with schedule IDs
- Falls back to direct execution if unavailable

**Demos with Fee Config:**
- Show fee configuration (educational)
- Don't enforce fees (for demo simplicity)

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Each Demo Without HCS-10

```bash
# Disable HCS-10
unset USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS
# or
export USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS=false

# Run demos - should work exactly as before
npm run demo
npm run demo:negotiation
npm run demo:invoice-llm 150
npm run demo:supply-chain-fraud
npm run demo:invoice 300
npm run demo:nft-royalty 200
npm run demo:hbar-x402 10
```

### Test Each Demo With HCS-10

```bash
# Enable HCS-10
export USE_HCS10_CONNECTIONS=true

# Run demos - should attempt HCS-10 features
npm run demo 0.0.7132337 10 hedera-testnet
npm run demo:negotiation
npm run demo:invoice-llm 800 "High-value invoice"
npm run demo:supply-chain-fraud
npm run demo:invoice 600
npm run demo:nft-royalty 200
npm run demo:hbar-x402 100  # Large amount to trigger approval
```
