# 🏆 Hedera Hackathon Demo Guide

## 🎯 Use Case: **Automated Cross-Chain Settlement for NFT Royalties**

### Problem Statement

**NFT marketplaces need to automatically settle creator royalties across different blockchains:**

- Creator sells NFT on Hedera (low fees)
- Marketplace needs to pay royalties on Base/Ethereum (where most users are)
- Current solution: Manual, slow, expensive

### Our Solution

**Autonomous Agent System that:**

1. **Monitors** Hedera NFT sales
2. **Calculates** royalty amounts due
3. **Automatically settles** payments on Base/Ethereum
4. **All cross-chain, autonomous, no human intervention**

---

## 🚀 Live Demo Walkthrough

### Step 1: Show the Problem

```bash
# Problem: Creator made NFT sale on Hedera
# Need to pay 10% royalty to creator on Ethereum (expensive!)

echo "💰 NFT Sale: 100 HBAR on Hedera"
echo "📋 Royalty Due: 10 HBAR → Convert to ~5 USDC on Base"
echo "❌ Current: Manual, takes 24+ hours"
echo "✅ Our Solution: Instant, autonomous"
```

### Step 2: Initialize Agents

```bash
npm run demo
```

**Output Shows:**

```

## 💡 Business Impact

### Before Our System

- ❌ Manual royalty distribution
- ❌ 24-48 hour settlement time
- ❌ High gas fees on Ethereum
- ❌ Centralized settlement service fees

### After Our System

- ✅ **Instant** autonomous settlement
- ✅ **Sub-10 second** Hedera transfers
- ✅ **Ultra-low fees** ($0.0001 per transaction)
- ✅ **Trustless** - No intermediaries

### ROI Calculation

```
100 NFT sales/day = 100 royalty payments
Current cost: $50/day in gas fees
Our solution: $0.01/day in fees
Daily savings: $49.99/day
Annual savings: $18,247/year
```
